        <h1><u>Variable in Python</u></h1>
        <p>Variables in Python are used to store data values,such as numbers,strings,or lists,which can be referenced and manipulated in a program.

            <h1>There are two types of Variables in Python.</h1>
            <ul>
                <li><i>Local Variable</i>
                <ul>
                    <br>
                    <li>In Python, a global variable is a variable that is defined outside of a function and can be accessed and modified from any function within the same script or module.</li>
                    <li>Modifying a Global Variable Inside a Function
                        By default, if you try to modify a global variable inside a function, Python treats it as a local variable, which can lead to errors. To modify a global variable inside a function, you must use the global keyword.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
